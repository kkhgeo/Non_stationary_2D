Non-stationary & Anisotropic Spatial Data Generator
📝 Overview
This project provides a Python script to generate 2D spatial data that exhibits both non-stationarity and anisotropy. The generated data is based on the Matérn covariance function, allowing for the simulation of complex spatial patterns where statistical properties—such as variance, correlation length, and directionality—change progressively across the field.

Such synthetic data is invaluable for research in spatial statistics and machine learning. It can be used to develop and validate advanced models like:

Sophisticated Kriging variants

Deep learning-based spatial prediction models (e.g., terrain elevation, soil contamination, or climate patterns)

✨ Key Features
Non-stationarity: Generates data where variance and correlation range change linearly across the spatial domain.

Anisotropy: Simulates direction-dependent spatial correlation. The angle and ratio of anisotropy can also vary spatially.

Matérn Covariance: Utilizes the flexible Matérn covariance model to control the smoothness of the generated field.

GeoTIFF Export: Saves the generated 2D grid data as a .tif file, readily usable in GIS software.

Easy Customization: Modify the params dictionary in the script to easily generate data with different characteristics.

📊 Generated Data Example
The following parameter set was used to produce a spatial field with gradually changing spatial properties:

params = {
    "variance_range": (0.5, 3.0),
    "range_param_range": (0.05, 0.5),
    "angle_range_deg": (-30, 60),
    "ratio_range": (1.5, 3.0)
}

This produces a texture where the scale, smoothness, and orientation of spatial variation evolve smoothly from left to right. Ideal for benchmarking non-stationary Gaussian process models or spatial deep learning architectures.
